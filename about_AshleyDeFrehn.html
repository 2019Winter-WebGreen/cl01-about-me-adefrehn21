            <!-- The paragraph below is some information to introduce myselff to the reader and give some background information about myself -->
            
                <p> <b> Hello Reader!</b> My name is Ashley DeFrehn and I am currently sixteen years old. I live in Lower Alloways Creek, New Jersey and I am currently a sophomore attending Padua Academy in Wilmington, Delaware. My house is located in the boonies and is in a very rural environment. By saying this I live off of a dirt road and there are cows that live a half mile behind my house. I have a younger sister named Amanda, who is thirteen years old and is in 8th grade attending St. Anthony of Padua Grade School. I have two younger cousins that carpool with us to school every morning and come home with us after school everyday as well. I also have female chocolate lab dog named, Molly, who is six years old.</p>
            
            <!-- The paragraph below is about some of the activities I enjoy doing or what my typical day entails -->
            
                <p> In my free time, I enjoy running, going to country music concerts, hanging out with my friends, and spending time with my family. I also love going to the beach with my cousins and friends. My mom has five siblings and by saying this, I come from a big family and have lots of cousins. I also travel to Missouri often throughout the year to visit our house out there. Often times after school I am babysitting my two cousins, Abigail and Stephen, or working at a local family owned Italian restauarant in Salem, NJ called, Ella's Mama Mia's about 12 minutes from my house. </p>
            
            <!-- The paragraph below is mostly about some events that have occured during my life or some fun facts about me -->
                
                <p> Some fun facts about me are that I used to do competitive archery in New Jersey, Delaware, and Pennsylvania. I was part of the Lancaster Archery <a href="https://www.lancasterarcheryacademy.com/Academy-JOAD-Club">JOAD</a> team
                in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. I was the New Jersey State Female Cub Outdoor Compound Bow Champ in 2014 and I placed 2nd in the New Jersey State Indoor Female Cub Compound Bow Competition in 2016. I am also legally blind in my left eye and was born with amblyopia that was passed down from my father's genes. I had eye surgery at A.I. Dupont Childrens Hospital when I was in 1st grade to strengthen my left eye by tightening the muscles. I also broke my tibia in two places in second grade while playing in a soccer game. When I was growing up, I was absolutely obsessed with Tinkerbell, making my all time favorite movie, <i> Tinker Bell, Secret of the Wings</i>. A quote I try to live by is from the mouth of Mohammad bin Salman:</p><blockquote> "I fear that the day I die, I am going to die without accomplishing what I have in my mind. Life is too short, and a lot of things can happen, and I am really keen to see it with my own eyes - and that is why I am in a hurry." </blockquote>
